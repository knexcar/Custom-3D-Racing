# Custom-3D-Racing
A project I created in high school senior class using the "Processing" application. My goal was to create a 3d game using only 2d drawing methods. I did this by using mathematical functions to transform the 3d points in space into 2d points on the screen, and some simple logic to decide what was drawn first.

The game is a racing game, played using the arrow keys (For player 1), WASD (Player 2), OKL; (Player 3), and 8456 (Player 4). The racer must drive his car around the track three times to win.

## Download
The project compiled for Windows (64 bit) can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2fztFEIv_baRy0xZVVFRGJJS0k/view?usp=sharing
Note that the file comes as a .zipp in order to prevent programs like Gmail for freaking out over an executable, so the extension must be changed to .zip before opening.

## Compiling the Code
The code was written in Processing, which can be downloaded at [https://processing.org/download/](https://processing.org/download/). CUSTOM_3D is the main file, and as required by Processing, it is located within a folder of the same name. In addition, the Minim libaray will have to be installed in order to run the program. To do this, in the Processing menu, go to Sketch > Import Library > Add Library, and in the "Contribution Manager" window that appears, select "Minim
