# Custom-3D-Racing
A project I created in high school senior class using the "Processing" application. My goal was to create a 3d game using only 2d drawing methods. I did this by using mathematical functions to transform the 3d points in space into 2d points on the screen, and some simple logic to decide what was drawn first.
