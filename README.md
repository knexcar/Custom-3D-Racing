# Custom-3D-Racing
A project I created in high school senior class using the "Processing" application. My goal was to create a 3d game using only 2d drawing methods. I did this by using mathematical functions to transform the 3d points in space into 2d points on the screen, and some simple logic to decide what was drawn first.

## Download
The project compiled for Windows (64 bit) can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2fztFEIv_baRy0xZVVFRGJJS0k/view?usp=sharing
Note that the file comes as a .zipp in order to prevent programs like Gmail for freaking out over an executable, so the extension must be changed to .zip before opening.

## Compiling the Code
The code was written in Processing, which can be downloaded at [https://processing.org/download/](https://processing.org/download/). CUSTOM_3D is the main file, and as required by Processing, it is located within a folder of the same name. Any external libraries should be handled by Processing (the only one used is minim, used for sounds).
